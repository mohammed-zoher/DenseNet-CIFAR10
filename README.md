# DenseNet-CIFAR10
A DenseNet is a CNN based acrhitecture that utilizes dense connection between layers to deal with the vanishing gradient problem. In this notebook, we will implement the DenseNet architecture as presented in the research paper to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

# Objective
Classify CIFAR-10 images using a DenseNet CNN implementation.

# Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries before running this project.

1. Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and scipy: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

# Getting Started
Start by downloading the project files and run the ".ipynb" file as a ipython-notebook (Jupyter notebook)

# Requirements
- Required Libraries are:
  -   numpy
  -   pandas
  -   tensorflow
  -   keras
  -   matplotlib
  -   seaborn
  -   python >= 3.7
  - Check the notebooks for more details
